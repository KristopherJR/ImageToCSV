# ImageToCSV
A basic program that reads an image and outputs a corresponding .csv file based on the RGB pixel values. This was developed for the creation of TileMaps for Nosocomephobia (COMP3451 - Advanced Game Design Project).

<h1>How to Use</h1>
Step 1: Prep your image, it can be binary (black & white) or black,white and one other colour. here is a 3x3 pixel example of a binary image with a black pixel in the centre:

Step 2: Open up the project and change the image path to the image you want to convert to a .csv. <br><br>
Step 3: Adjust the custom pixel field to the RGB value of the other colour in your image (if you used a non-binary image). <br><br>
Step 4: Tune the output settings to your needs. <br><br>
Step 5: Run the program, by default the .csv will be placed in the bin/debug folder. You can change this in the same place you set your image. <br><br>
Step 6: You're done! <br>

The output looks like this:

Feel free to use this program and make changes on your own branches as you see fit. The program may be updated to handle more than just binary images in future.
